# AI/ML Engineering Challenge: Predictive Product Categorizer ü§ñüõí

In the world of e-commerce, accurate product categorization is essential for a seamless user experience. Manually assigning categories to thousands of new products is time-consuming and prone to human error.

## üìù Challenge Details

### **Description**

This challenge requires you to build a machine learning model that automatically classifies product descriptions into predefined categories. You'll be working with a real-world dataset to develop a solution that can be integrated into an e-commerce system.

### **Instructions**

1.  **Dataset Acquisition:** You'll need to find a suitable dataset for e-commerce product categorization. A great place to start is Kaggle, which has several public datasets for this exact purpose. Look for a dataset with product titles or descriptions and corresponding categories.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** This is a critical step. Your product descriptions will be text data, which needs to be cleaned and prepared for your model.
    * Perform text normalization (e.g., convert to lowercase, remove punctuation and special characters).
    * Handle any missing values in the data.
    * Consider techniques like tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization to prepare the text.
3.  **Feature Engineering:** Convert the cleaned text data into a numerical format that your model can understand. A common and effective technique for this problem is using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**. You'll use scikit-learn's `TfidfVectorizer` for this.
4.  **Model Training:**
    * Split your data into training and testing sets.
    * Choose a suitable classification model from a library like scikit-learn. Good starting points for text classification include **Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**, or a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**.
    * Train your chosen model on the training data.
5.  **Model Evaluation:**
    * Evaluate your model's performance using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and the **F1-score**.
    * Create a classification report and a confusion matrix to demonstrate your model's performance on the test set.
6.  **Submission:** Your final submission should be a Python script or a Jupyter Notebook that executes all the steps from data loading to model evaluation. All code should be clean, well-commented, and runnable.

### **‚úÖ Expected Deliverables**

* **`README.md`:** This is your primary deliverable. It should be a comprehensive document detailing your project.
    * **Project Overview:** Briefly explain the problem you are solving and your approach.
    * **Data Exploration:** Provide a brief summary of the dataset you used, including the number of samples, categories, and a few examples of raw data.
    * **Methodology:** Explain your data preprocessing steps and the model you chose, with a clear rationale for your decisions.
    * **Results:** Present the evaluation metrics of your model (accuracy, F1-score, etc.) and interpret what they mean.
    * **Conclusion:** Discuss what you learned and how the model could be improved in the future (e.g., trying a different model, using more advanced NLP techniques like word embeddings, or fine-tuning hyperparameters).
* **Python Code:** Your well-structured Python script (`.py` file) or Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) containing the full code for the project.
* **Requirements File:** A `requirements.txt` file listing all the Python libraries used (e.g., `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`).
