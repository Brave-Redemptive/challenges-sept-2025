# Deconstructing the E-commerce Checkout Flow Challenge

This one-week challenge will equip you with the skills to analyze a complex system and identify user experience improvements at a macro level. You will work on the same problem as the software engineers‚Äîan e-commerce checkout flow‚Äîto practice holistic, system-level design thinking. Your deliverables will focus on user journeys, information architecture, and proposing UX enhancements for a modular system.

## üìù Challenge Details

### **Title: Deconstructing the E-commerce Checkout Flow**

### **Description**
You are a Product Designer tasked with improving the user experience of an outdated, monolithic e-commerce checkout process. You need to analyze the current system, map out the user journey, and propose a new, modular UX architecture that aligns with a microservices approach. Your goal is to redesign the user experience for key parts of the checkout funnel to be more intuitive, efficient, and scalable.

### **Instructions**
1.  **System Analysis & User Flow Mapping**: Begin by analyzing a typical e-commerce checkout flow. Map out the current user journey from the moment an item is added to the cart to the final order confirmation. Identify every step, decision point, and potential point of friction.
2.  **UX Problem Identification**: Based on your user flow map, identify and document at least three key **UX problems** or pain points in the existing checkout process (e.g., confusing navigation, a high number of steps, lack of clear feedback).
3.  **Modular UX Architecture**: Propose a **new, modular UX architecture** that breaks down the checkout flow into independent components, mirroring the microservices approach. For example, a "Cart Component," a "Shipping & Payment Component," and a "Order Review Component." Explain why this modular approach benefits the user.
4.  **Wireframes & Prototypes**: Create low-fidelity wireframes or a clickable prototype for one of the identified pain points. For example, redesign the cart page or the final order summary page to be more user-friendly. Your design should clearly address one of the UX problems you identified earlier.
5.  **Documentation**: Present all your findings, analyses, and designs in a well-structured Google Doc.

## ‚úÖ Expected Deliverables

* **Google Doc**: A single, well-organized Google Doc link with all your work. The document should include:
    * **User Journey Map**: A visual representation of the current checkout flow.
    * **UX Problem Analysis**: A list of at least three identified pain points with explanations.
    * **Modular UX Proposal**: A brief write-up explaining your proposed modular UX architecture.
    * **Wireframes/Prototype**: A section with your redesigned screens (as images or a link to a Figma/Adobe XD prototype).
* **Figma/Adobe XD Prototype (Optional)**: A link to a clickable prototype demonstrating your proposed solution.
