# Product Design Week 10 Challenge

## Challenge Title

**Presenting & Writing Design Decisions: Communicating Clarity, Intent, and Rationale**

## Scenario / Description

You’ve joined **ClarityUX**, a global SaaS company where designers collaborate closely with engineers, PMs, and business stakeholders. The leadership team has noticed that while designers produce visually appealing work, they struggle to **communicate their design decisions effectively**—leading to misunderstandings, misaligned expectations, and weak cross-functional collaboration.

As a **Product Designer**, your challenge this week is to craft a strong, structured design rationale and present your design decisions with clarity and persuasion. This challenge focuses on strengthening one of the most critical skills in product design: **articulating the 'why' behind the design.**

## Challenge Overview

You are required to:

* Choose a simple product feature (onboarding, checkout, profile update, dashboard widget, etc.).
* Design **2–3 high-fidelity screens**.
* Write a structured design decision document that explains:

  * The problem
  * The constraints
  * The goals
  * The principles applied
  * The decisions taken (with options considered & trade-offs)
  * The expected impact
* Present your design decisions using a clear, repeatable framework.
* Deliver both a **Figma/Sketch/Framer prototype** and a **Google Doc**.

4. Create an **accessible prototype link**: Figma, Sketch, or Framer.
5. Your Google Doc must have clear headings, screenshots, and reasoning.
