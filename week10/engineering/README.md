# Software Engineering Week 10 Challenge

## Challenge Title

**Code Reviews & Distributed Collaboration: Building High‑Quality Software as a Remote Team**

## Scenario / Description

You’ve joined **SyncForge**, a fully remote software company with engineers distributed across 10+ countries. The engineering leadership discovered that inconsistent code review processes and poor collaboration habits are causing defects, merge conflicts, and slow delivery.

As a **Software Engineer**, your responsibility this week is to work as if you are part of a globally distributed team. You will design a **remote‑friendly workflow**, implement a feature using **Node.js (backend)** and **React‑Vite (frontend)**, and follow strict **code review practices**, **branching conventions**, and **collaboration protocols**.

Your work must demonstrate real‑world engineering behaviors: clean Git workflows, thoughtful PRs, structured documentation, and automated checks.

---

## Challenge Overview

You are required to:

* Build a small feature in a **Node.js (Express)** backend + **React‑Vite** frontend.
* Use a **clean Git branching strategy** (e.g., Gitflow or trunk‑based development).
* Create **meaningful Pull Requests (PRs)** with templates.
* Perform **mock code reviews** and incorporate feedback.
* Use GitHub Projects + Issues to simulate distributed team collaboration.
* Add automated linting/testing via GitHub Actions.
* Provide clear documentation demonstrating your collaboration workflow.

## Instructions

1. Create **two private GitHub repositories**:

   * `syncforge-backend`
   * `syncforge-frontend`
2. Backend Requirements:

   * Node.js + Express app with at least **two API endpoints**.
   * Clean folder structure.
   * Basic validation and error handling.
   * API documented via **Postman**.
3. Frontend Requirements:

   * React‑Vite app that consumes backend APIs.
   * At least **two screens/pages**.
   * Clear loading & error states.
4. Collaboration Requirements:

   * Create **a GitHub Project board** (Kanban style).
   * Create at least **5 GitHub Issues** with clear titles & acceptance criteria.
   * Use a **branching strategy** (feature branches, PR merges, etc.).
   * Create **PR templates**.
   * Open at least **3 Pull Requests** demonstrating:

     * Well‑written descriptions
     * Linked issues
     * Screenshots or API samples
     * Checklists
   * Do **2 mock code reviews** (you can comment on your own PRs or simulate multiple reviewers).
5. Automation Requirement:

   * Add GitHub Actions to run linting or tests.
6. Documentation Requirement:

   * In README, document:

     * Collaboration workflow
     * Branching rules
     * Code review philosophy
     * Screenshots of PRs & Issues

## Expected Deliverables

* **Backend Repository (`syncforge-backend`)**:

  * Node.js API implementation
  * PR templates
  * GitHub Issues
  * GitHub Project board
  * Postman documentation
  * GitHub Actions workflow
* **Frontend Repository (`syncforge-frontend`)**:

  * React‑Vite implementation
  * Issues + PRs
  * GitHub Actions workflow
* Clear README documentation on workflow & collaboration practices.

## Submission Guidelines

1. Ensure both repositories (**backend and frontend**) are **private**.
2. Fork the submission repository at [Fundamentals Cohort1 Submissions](https://github.com/Brave-Redemptive/fundamentals-cohort1-submissions)
3. Clone the repo from the forked version on your account to your PC.
4. Add the original repo as a second upstream to easily pull updates.
5. Create a folder with your GitHub username.
6. Create a subfolder inside the folder you created above and name it 'week8'.
7. In this folder, you'll have two folders named backend, and frontend.
8. After you've made your modifications, then push to your online version.
9. Finally, make a pull request to the main fundamentals account.
10. Note that some of the steps will only be done once.
10. Watch [This Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxh6MhK6Tbs) to be up to speed on the submission workflow.
4. Deadline for submission is **Friday, 11:59 PM**.
5. Submissions are due by the end of the week. **Late submissions will not be reviewed.**


## Duration

🗓️ **Challenge Duration:** 1 week (Monday to Friday)

### Notes

* This challenge mirrors how high‑performing remote teams collaborate.
* The emphasis is not only on coding, but on **communication**, **process**, and **team discipline**.
* Treat your repositories as if multiple engineers are depending on your structure and clarity.
