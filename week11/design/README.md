# Product Design Challenge – Navigating Ambiguous Trade-offs

## Title

Designing a Product Feature Under Ambiguous Trade-offs

## Description

You’re working with **FinTech startup “MoneyMap”**, a company that builds personal finance management apps. The team is considering adding a new **“Smart Budget Recommendation” feature**.

The challenge is that multiple trade-offs exist:

* Accuracy vs. simplicity of recommendations
* Privacy vs. personalization
* Development speed vs. scalability

Your task is to **analyze these trade-offs, make informed design decisions, and propose a feature solution** that balances competing priorities while documenting your reasoning clearly.

This challenge emphasizes **decision-making under uncertainty**, which is a critical skill for product designers in fast-paced, real-world environments.

## Instructions

1. Identify the **main trade-offs** inherent in the feature.
2. Define **user personas** impacted by these trade-offs.
3. Propose **at least two alternative designs** or approaches that balance these trade-offs.
4. Evaluate the **pros and cons** of each design choice.
5. Create **wireframes or mockups** for your preferred solution (low or medium fidelity).
6. Document your **decision-making rationale**, explicitly explaining why you chose your solution over alternatives.
7. Provide **any assumptions** you made and how they affect your design.

## Expected Deliverables

* A **Google Doc** containing:

  1. User personas
  2. Trade-off analysis table (highlighting key conflicts and impacts)
  3. Two alternative designs with pros/cons
  4. Wireframes/mockups of the preferred design
  5. Decision rationale
* Optional: PDFs or images for visual references if needed
