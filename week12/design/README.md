# Product Design Week 12 Challenge

## Title

**Redesigning a High-Friction Onboarding Flow for a Fintech App (Design + Strategic Defense)**

## Description

You’ve been hired as a Product Designer at **Finexa**, a rapidly growing fintech startup offering savings, micro‑loans, and bill‑payment services. The company has identified a major drop-off during its **user onboarding and KYC verification flow**.

You have been **tasked with redesigning the onboarding experience** to:

* Reduce friction
* Improve clarity and trust
* Create a consistent UX
* Increase onboarding completion rates

Beyond redesigning, you must provide a **Strategic Defense** documenting *why* your design decisions solve the problem effectively—similar to defending a design proposal to leadership.

## Instructions

1. **Study the current onboarding flow** provided in the `/references` folder (screenshots or descriptions you will create).
2. Identify **key friction points**, UX problems, trust gaps, and accessibility issues.
3. Redesign the full onboarding journey including:

   * Landing → Account creation
   * Phone/email verification
   * KYC ID upload
   * Selfie verification
   * Final dashboard intro screen
4. Produce **high-fidelity UI screens** using Figma.
5. Create a **User Flow diagram** and an **Information Architecture (IA)** diagram.
6. Provide a **Strategic Defense** section explaining:

   * Why this new flow improves completion
   * How you addressed trust, clarity, and cognitive load
   * Trade-offs you considered (security vs speed, compliance vs UX, simplicity vs information needs)
   * UX principles applied (progressive disclosure, affordances, accessibility, heuristics)
   * Metrics you expect to improve
7. Prepare a **Google Doc** containing:

   * Problem analysis
   * UX audit
   * Complete redesign rationale
   * Design strategy
   * Screenshots or embedded Figma frames
   * Metrics strategy
   * Strategic Defense (detailed)

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Figma file** containing:

   * Redesigned high-fidelity onboarding screens
   * User flow diagram
   * IA diagram
2. **Google Doc** containing:

   * Problem breakdown
   * UX research (heuristics + competitor insights)
   * Screens from the redesign
   * Strategic Defense section
3. **Optional:** A short Loom video walking through your design.
