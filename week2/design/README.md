# üé® Design Challenge Week 2: The Fast Interaction Flow
## Title: Optimizing the Mobile Ingredient Quantity Update Flow


### Description
As a Product Designer with **1-2 years of experience**, you are tasked with optimizing a core function of a high-frequency mobile utility app: a personalized digital pantry tracker. Home cooks check and update their ingredient inventory (quantities of milk, eggs, spices, etc.) multiple times a day.

The current update process is slow (requiring keyboard input and multiple taps). Your goal is to redesign the **quantity update flow** to be highly efficient, low-friction, and require minimal cognitive effort, enabling users to update an item's count in less than **one second**. This is a deep dive into **micro-interactions, touch target size, and cognitive efficiency.**

### Instructions

#### üéØ Phase 1: Analysis and Goal Setting

1.  **Current Flow Mapping:** Define the typical "slow" current flow (e.g., Tap Item $\rightarrow$ Open Edit Screen $\rightarrow$ Tap Quantity Field $\rightarrow$ Open Keyboard $\rightarrow$ Type new number $\rightarrow$ Tap Save).
2.  **Define Target Interaction:** Based on the "frequent, fast interaction" topic, identify the most efficient way to achieve quantity adjustment (e.g., using inline steppers, swipe gestures, long-press actions, or a custom tap-based number selector).
3.  **Apply Design Laws:** Research and apply **Fitts's Law** (ensuring large, easily targetable touch areas for high-frequency buttons) and **Hick's Law** (reducing the number of choices available at each step).

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 2: Design and Prototyping

1.  **Glanceable View:** Design the main screen where the user views their inventory list. Focus on minimizing visual noise and maximizing readability of the key data point (the current quantity).
2.  **Rapid Update UI:** Design the UI components specifically for updating the quantity. The solution should avoid opening the native mobile keyboard for simple changes like $\pm 1$ or $\pm 5$. Create a solution that accommodates both small, frequent adjustments and large, occasional adjustments.
3.  **Interaction Prototype:** Build a high-fidelity interactive prototype (using Figma, Sketch, or Framer) that clearly demonstrates the speed and minimal friction of your optimized flow. The focus should be on how the user's hand and fingers interact with the screen.

#### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Rationale and Reporting

1.  Document your entire process, justifying every design choice by referencing the principles of fast interaction and cognitive load reduction.

### Expected Deliverables

The output should be a single, well-structured document (Google Doc) containing the following sections and your Figma/Sketch/Framer Viewable Link:

1.  **Problem & Goal Summary:** A brief (1-paragraph) statement summarizing the problem (high latency in quantity update) and the design goal (sub-one-second update time).
2.  **User Flow Map (Before & After):** Visual representation of the initial flow versus your optimized flow, showing the reduction in required steps/taps.

3.  **Key Screens (Static Mockups):**
    * The **Main Inventory List Screen** (Glanceable View).
    * The **Optimized Quantity Interaction Screen/Component**.
4.  **Interaction Rationale:** A detailed section explaining *how* your design incorporates:
    * Fitts‚Äôs Law (touch target size/placement).
    * Reduction of Cognitive Load (simplicity and immediate feedback).
5.  **Interactive Prototype Link:** A publicly accessible link to your Figma, Sketch, or Framer prototype demonstrating the fast update flow.
