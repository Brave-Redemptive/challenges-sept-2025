# ðŸ”’ SE Challenge Week 3: Secure Multi-Role API Development

### **Title:** **Building a Secure, Token-Based Node.js API with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

### **Description**

You are tasked with building a minimalist **Task Management Platform API and client** that supports two distinct user roles: **'Basic User'** and **'Admin'**. The core of this challenge is not just to make the application *work*, but to make it *secure* and resilient against common web attacks.

You must implement a robust **JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication and authorization** system using Node.js and demonstrate secure practices to mitigate critical vulnerabilities, specifically focusing on **Broken Access Control** (OWASP A01:2021) and **Injection** (OWASP A03:2021).

### **Technology Stack Requirements**

| Component | Required Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Backend** | **Node.js** (using Express, **not** NestJS) |
| **Frontend** | **React-Vite** or **Next.js** |
| **Data Storage** | Light database (e.g., MongoDB or PostgresSQL for user data) |

### **Instructions**

#### **1. Backend Implementation (Node.js/Express)**

* Implement **User Registration** and **Login** endpoints. **Passwords must be hashed** (e.g., using `bcrypt` or similar).
* Implement **JWT Generation** on successful login, issuing a short-lived **Access Token** (for protected routes) and a longer-lived **Refresh Token** (for renewing the Access Token).
* Create a **Token Refresh** endpoint that securely validates the Refresh Token and issues a new Access Token without requiring re-login.
* Add a security layer for login such that, if a user supplies wrong password three times, their account gets locked for 30 minutes and it is automatically unlocked after 30 minutes.
* Implement a system to store user data, including their assigned **role** (`user` or `admin`). Ensure you have a mechanism (e.g., a simple blacklist/database record) to **revoke/blacklist refresh tokens** upon user-initiated logout.
* Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** middleware to protect the following API routes:
    * `GET /api/tasks` (Accessible by: **User** and **Admin**)
    * `POST /api/tasks` (Accessible by: **User** and **Admin**)
    * `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` (Accessible by: **Admin ONLY**)
* Implement **Input Validation** and **Data Sanitization** on the registration and task creation endpoints to prevent **Injection** attacks ( Make sure you write your validations yourself, no libraries! ).
* Utilize security middleware (e.g., **Helmet**) to set secure HTTP headers (like CSP, XSS protection, etc.) to enhance defense.
* Implement robust search and filter endpoints for tasks, with proper paginated responses:
    * `POST /api/tasks/search` (Accessible by: **User** and **Admin**)
    * `POST /api/tasks/filter` (Accessible by: **User** and **Admin**)
* NB: Search and Filter for User only returns information from tasks on their account.

#### **2. Frontend Implementation (React-Vite/Next.js)**

* Develop a basic client application with **Registration and Login** interfaces.
* Implement a secure client-side strategy for handling JWTs. **Crucially, the short-lived Access Token must NOT be stored in standard, client-side browser \`localStorage\`** due to XSS risks. Explain your chosen secure storage method (e.g., HttpOnly cookies managed by the backend, or storing the token in client-side memory) in your `README.md`.
* Build a simple UI to display the task list, allowing all logged-in users to create tasks.
* Ensure that the **Task Delete** button is only functional and visible to users with the **Admin** role, and that the backend properly rejects unauthorized \`DELETE\` requests from 'Basic User' accounts (even if a user attempts to manually trigger the request).

### **Expected Deliverables**

1.  A fully functional **Node.js API** repository on GitHub.
2.  A fully functional **React-Vite/Next.js Frontend** repository on GitHub (can be a separate repo or a mono-repo structure).
3.  A detailed **`README.md`** file in the API repository that includes:
    * Setup and running instructions for both the backend and frontend.
    * A technical explanation of the **JWT flow**, token rotation strategy, and secure token storage method used.
    * A dedicated section detailing how you mitigated **Broken Access Control (A01)** and **Injection (A03)** vulnerabilities.

## **Challenge Rubrics (Total 100 Points)**

Submissions will be scored based on the following competencies:

| Skill/Competence Focus | Description | Max Points |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Functionality & Completeness** | All required routes (Register, Login, Refresh, Task CRUD) are implemented, functional, and correctly integrated between the client and API. | 20 |
| **Secure Token Implementation (A07)** | Correct use of **JWTs (Access/Refresh)**, proper handling of token expiration, and secure storage (explicitly avoiding vulnerable \`localStorage\`). | 25 |
| **Role-Based Access Control (A01)** | The **Admin-only** restriction on the \`DELETE\` task route is strictly enforced by the backend middleware, demonstrating robust **Broken Access Control** mitigation. | 20 |
| **Vulnerability Mitigation (A03)** | Effective **input validation and sanitization** are implemented on user inputs (e.g., preventing XSS/Injection in usernames or task content). | 15 |
| **Code Quality & Best Practices** | Clean, well-structured Node.js/React code; consistent use of modern asynchronous patterns (\`async\`/\`await\`); appropriate use of environment variables for secrets. | 10 |
