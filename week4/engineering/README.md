# Software Engineering Week 4 Challenge

### **Title:** DevConnect - A Lightweight Developer Collaboration Platform

---

### **Description:**

In this challenge, you will build a simplified version of a real-world collaboration platform ‚Äî **DevConnect** ‚Äî where developers can create profiles, share project ideas, comment on other projects, and collaborate. The goal is to create an **end-to-end system** covering backend, frontend, and deployment, showcasing your ability to design and implement a complete, production-ready application.

You will use **Node.js (Express)** for the backend API and **React + Vite** (or **Next.js**) for the frontend. The system should include authentication, basic CRUD operations, and a clean UI.

---

### **Instructions:**

1. **Backend (Node.js + Express)**

   * Implement RESTful APIs for user authentication, project posts, and comments.
   * Use **MongoDB** (via Mongoose) or **PostgreSQL** as your database.
   * Ensure proper error handling and input validation.
   * Include environment variables for configuration.
   * Write at least **3 meaningful unit tests** using Jest or Mocha.
   * Create and publish **Postman API Documentation** for all endpoints.

2. **Frontend (React + Vite or Next.js)**

   * Implement authentication (login/signup/logout).
   * Create pages for project listing, project details, and user profiles.
   * Allow users to post new projects and comment on others.
   * Use a clean, minimal UI (you may use TailwindCSS).

3. **Deployment**

   * Deploy your backend on **Render**, **Railway**, or **Vercel**.
   * Deploy your frontend on **Vercel** or **Netlify**.
   * Ensure the frontend communicates correctly with the deployed backend.

4. **Documentation**

   * Include a README.md with setup, tech stack, and deployment instructions.
   * Include screenshots or a demo video (optional but encouraged).

---

### **Expected Deliverables:**

* Two **separate GitHub repositories**:

  * One for **Backend (Node.js + Express)**.
  * One for **Frontend (React + Vite or Next.js)**.
* Each repository must include:

  * A detailed `README.md` file with setup and run instructions.
  * A deployed live URL.
  * Unit test results (in screenshot or test report form).
  * **Postman API Documentation link** (for backend repository).
* All repositories **must be private**, and participants should invite **@braveredemptive** for access.

### **Learning Resources:**

* üìò **PDF Resource:** [Building a RESTful API with Node.js and Express](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/04/express-api-backend-project-postgresql/)
* üé• **Video Resource:** [React + Express Fullstack Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe421EPjeBE)

---

### **Submission Guidelines:**

* Push your complete project to **two private GitHub repositories** (one for backend, one for frontend).
* Invite **@braveredemptive** to both repositories for review access.
* Ensure both applications are deployed and accessible online.
* Log your submission entry in this **[Google Submission Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/131My2Yo2ekHu9KR9v0-NOfFENDiNm8rT0UEXBhUrkbc/edit?usp=drivesdk)**.
* Include repository links, live demo links, and API documentation link in the submission sheet.
* **Deadline for submission is Friday, 11:59 PM.**
* **Submissions are due by the end of the week. Late submissions will not be reviewed.**

### **Challenge Duration:**

‚è∞ One week (7 days)

This challenge simulates a real-world software engineering task, combining **API design, frontend development, documentation, and deployment**, ideal for participants with **1‚Äì2 years of experience**.
