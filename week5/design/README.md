## Challenge Title

**Behavioral Loops and Habit-Building UX for a Wellness App**

## Description

You're part of the **Product Design team** at **PulseTrack**, a digital wellness startup that helps users build healthier habits through micro-interactions, reminders, and progress visualization. The company is focused on creating experiences that **encourage daily engagement** and **sustain long-term user motivation**.

Your task this week is to design a **mobile experience** that uses **behavioral loops** (cue ‚Üí action ‚Üí reward ‚Üí investment) to help users build and maintain a healthy daily habit, such as hydration tracking, step count goals, or meditation consistency.

This challenge will help you explore **habit-forming UX design**, **motivational triggers**, and **feedback loops** that keep users coming back to the app.
