# Software Engineering Week 5 Challenge

## Challenge Title

**Database Modeling for Complex Entities**

## Scenario / Description

You're working as a **Backend Software Engineer** at **PulseTrack**, a company building a comprehensive health monitoring application that integrates user fitness data, meal tracking, and medical appointments into a single ecosystem. Your task this week is to design and implement a **robust database model** to handle the complex relationships among these entities.

The challenge focuses on your ability to design and implement an efficient database schema, establish clear relationships, and expose endpoints to interact with the data via a Node.js backend and a React-Vite frontend.

---

## Challenge Overview

You are required to:

* Design a **database schema** that captures relationships between multiple complex entities (Users, Activities, Meals, Doctors, Appointments, and Reports).
* Implement a **Node.js backend (Express)** that performs CRUD operations using this schema.
* Build a **React-Vite frontend** that interacts with your backend API for displaying and creating data.
* Document your APIs using **Postman**.

---

## Instructions

1. Create two **separate GitHub repositories**:

   * One for the **backend** (`pulsetrack-backend`)
   * One for the **frontend** (`pulsetrack-frontend`)
2. Backend Requirements:

   * Use **Node.js + Express.js**.
   * Use **MongoDB** with an ORM (Mongoose).
   * Implement endpoints for CRUD operations on at least **3 related entities** (e.g., Users, Activities, and Appointments).
   * Ensure relationships are well-defined (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).
   * Include **Postman API documentation**.
3. Frontend Requirements:

   * Use **React-Vite**.
   * Create simple UI screens to **view and create** data from the backend.
   * Ensure proper error handling and loading states.
4. Commit your code regularly with meaningful commit messages.
5. Your repositories **must be private**. Invite **@braveredemptive** for review and submission purposes.

---

## Expected Deliverables

* **Backend (Node.js)** repository (`pulsetrack-backend`):

  * Well-structured code using Express.
  * ORM-based database models.
  * Environment variable setup and database connection.
  * Postman API documentation (JSON or public Postman link).
* **Frontend (React-Vite)** repository (`pulsetrack-frontend`):

  * Basic CRUD interface.
  * API integration with the backend.
  * Clean and readable component structure.
* **README.md** file for both repos, detailing setup instructions.
* **Postman API Documentation** link or file.
