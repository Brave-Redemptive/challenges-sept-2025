# Product Design Weekl 6 Challenge

## Challenge Title

**Designing Emotion: Empty States, Microcopy, and Delight**

## Scenario / Description

You‚Äôre a **Product Designer** at **FlowServe**, a fast-growing productivity app company aiming to enhance user engagement through emotionally intelligent design. The product team has discovered that many users drop off during moments of inactivity or when encountering empty states in the app.

Your task this week is to **design emotional touchpoints** through **empty states**, **microcopy**, and **delightful UI interactions** that turn user inaction into engagement. You‚Äôll use design storytelling and behavioral design to connect emotionally with users while keeping the product practical and on-brand.

* Design **three key emotional touchpoints** in a digital product: an empty state, an error state, and a success state.
* Incorporate **effective microcopy** (tone, context, empathy) in each.
* Add **subtle delight** elements‚Äîmicro-interactions, illustrations, or animations.
* Present your final solution using **Figma**, **Sketch**, or **Framer**.
* Document your design thinking and rationale in a **Google Doc**.

   * **Success State:** When a task or action completes successfully.
3. Include:

   * **Microcopy** that reflects the product‚Äôs tone and builds trust.
   * **Delight elements** (animation, illustration, or motion cues).
4. Ensure your prototype link (Figma, Sketch, or Framer) is **accessible (view or comment access)**.
5. Document your rationale, tone guide, and behavior design insights in a Google Doc.
6. Keep the experience simple, human, and emotionally intelligent.
