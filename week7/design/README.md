# Product Design Week 7 Challenge

## Challenge Title

**Privacy + Trust UX: Designing for Transparency and User Confidence**

## Scenario / Description

You’ve joined **CodePilot Design**, a company developing a personal finance management app that helps users monitor their spending and track savings goals. Recently, user feedback revealed growing concerns around **data privacy**, **information transparency**, and **trust in the app’s data usage**.

As a **Product Designer**, your task this week is to design experiences that foster **trust**, **transparency**, and **control** — ensuring users feel safe and in charge of their data. Your challenge focuses on creating **privacy-first UX flows** and **trust-building moments** throughout the product experience.

---

## Challenge Overview

You are required to:

* Choose a product context (e.g., personal finance app, health tracker, or social network).
* Identify **three critical trust moments** in the user journey — e.g., onboarding, permissions, or data-sharing settings.
* Design UX flows and screens that:

  * Clearly **communicate data usage** and privacy.
  * Empower users with **control over their information**.
  * Use **transparent and human-centered language**.
* Incorporate **visual trust signals** (tone, icons, layout, and microcopy) to make the experience reassuring and credible.
* Present your work via **Figma**, **Sketch**, or **Framer**.

---

## Instructions

1. Pick a product use case where privacy and trust are essential (e.g., fintech, healthcare, messaging).
2. Design at least **three flows/screens** illustrating key trust interactions:

   * **Onboarding Privacy Consent Flow** — users understand and agree to data use.
   * **Data Control Center** — users view and manage shared data and permissions.
   * **Sensitive Action Flow** — confirmation before performing high-risk or private actions.
3. Ensure:

   * **Accessible language** (clear, non-legalistic microcopy).
   * **Consistent visual design** reinforcing brand trust.
   * **Delightful but respectful interactions** (no dark patterns).
4. Your prototype link (Figma/Sketch/Framer) must be **accessible (view or comment access)**.
5. Document your rationale in a **Google Doc**, explaining how each flow enhances privacy and trust.

---

## Expected Deliverables

* **Figma / Sketch / Framer Link** (accessible).
* **Google Doc** including:

  * Design context and selected use case.
  * Three designed flows (screenshots or embedded frames).
  * Explanation of trust patterns, privacy language, and visual decisions.
  * Rationale behind design choices.
  * Notes on ethical considerations and compliance awareness (e.g., GDPR-inspired UX patterns).

### Notes
