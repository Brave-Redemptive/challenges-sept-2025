# Product Design Weekly Challenge

## Challenge Title

**Reducing Harm: Building Ethical Defaults in Product Design**

## Scenario / Description

You’ve joined **Ethos**, a social technology company focused on designing digital experiences that promote well-being, fairness, and informed decision-making. Recent user feedback and ethical audits revealed subtle dark patterns in parts of the app — such as opt-out privacy settings, manipulative notifications, and confusing consent flows.

As a **Product Designer**, your task this week is to redesign one or more product experiences to reduce harm, increase user agency, and introduce **ethical defaults** that align with the principles of trust, consent, and inclusivity.

Your design decisions should reflect empathy, transparency, and ethical responsibility while balancing product goals and user autonomy.

---

## Challenge Overview

You are required to:

* Identify one common pattern in digital products that often causes harm or confusion (e.g., misleading consent, hidden fees, manipulative UX, notification overload).
* Redesign the experience using **ethical defaults** — clear, respectful, and empowering choices.
* Communicate intent, impact, and reasoning through your design and documentation.
* Present your solution using **Figma**, **Sketch**, or **Framer**.

---

## Instructions

1. Choose one context (examples):

   * **Privacy & Data Sharing:** Redesign a consent or privacy flow with clear, balanced choices.
   * **Notification & Engagement:** Redesign a system that respects attention and mental health.
   * **Subscription & Billing:** Create transparent pricing and opt-in mechanisms.
   * **Accessibility & Inclusion:** Design ethical defaults for differently-abled or marginalized users.
2. Create **3–4 key screens or flows** that demonstrate your ethical redesign.
3. Ensure your prototype link (Figma/Sketch/Framer) is **accessible (view/comment access)**.
4. Prepare a **Google Doc** with:

   * The ethical issue you’re addressing.
   * The harm caused by the current (or typical) design.
   * Your design decisions, principles applied, and expected user outcomes.
5. Include visual and written examples of how your design prevents or reduces harm.
6. Document any trade-offs or product considerations (e.g., engagement metrics vs. ethical impact).

---

## Expected Deliverables

* **Figma / Sketch / Framer Prototype Link** (accessible).
* **Google Doc** including:

  * Problem statement and ethical analysis.
  * Screenshots or embedded design frames.
  * Ethical principles used (autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, fairness, transparency).
  * Description of design process and rationale.
  * Reflection on long-term social or behavioral impact.
