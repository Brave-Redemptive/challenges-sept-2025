## 🧱 Software Engineering Challenge

**Topic:** CI/CD + Observability — Building Reliable and Insightful Delivery Pipelines
**Company Context:** DeployHub — a SaaS company improving deployment reliability and transparency.

### Objective

Design and implement a **CI/CD pipeline** with integrated **observability** for a Node.js + React application. The goal is to ensure automated deployments, efficient monitoring, and rapid visibility into system health and performance.

### Key Deliverables

* Node.js (Express) backend and React-Vite frontend in **separate private repositories**.
* Automated CI/CD workflows using **GitHub Actions**.
* Observability tools integrated (logging, metrics, tracing).
* Dockerized services deployed on Render, Railway, or Vercel.
* Postman API documentation.

### Learning Resources

* 📘 [CI/CD Pipeline Design — Google Cloud Architecture Framework](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-continuous-delivery-pipelines)
* 🎥 [Observability for Developers: Metrics, Logs, and Tracing Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3t8nDg7Jb4)

## 🤖 AI/ML Engineering Challenge

**Topic:** CI/CD + Observability for Machine Learning Systems
**Company Context:** DeployHub AI — enabling continuous and observable ML deployments.

### Objective

Build a **CI/CD pipeline** for an ML lifecycle — including data preprocessing, training, testing, and deployment — with **observability layers** for logs, metrics, and model performance monitoring. Focus on reliability, automation, and transparency.

### Key Deliverables

* ML repository (`deployhubai-ml`) with training, evaluation, and test automation.
* API repository (`deployhubai-api`) exposing FastAPI/Flask endpoints for inference.
* CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) automating build, test, and deploy.
* Observability setup with logging, metrics, and model drift indicators.
* Postman documentation for endpoints.

## 🎨 Product Design Challenge

**Topic:** Reducing Harm — Building Ethical Defaults in Product Design
**Company Context:** Ethos — designing socially responsible and ethical technology.

### Objective

Redesign a product flow to **reduce harm and increase user agency**. Identify harmful or manipulative design patterns and replace them with **ethical defaults** that promote user trust, consent, and well-being.

### Key Deliverables

* Figma / Sketch / Framer prototype link (accessible).
* Google Doc outlining:

  * Ethical issue being addressed.
  * Screens demonstrating the redesign (3–4 key flows).
  * Ethical principles used (autonomy, beneficence, fairness, etc.).
  * Reflection on trade-offs and potential impact.

### Learning Resources

* 📘 [Designing Ethical Technology: Principles of Human-Centered Ethics (Stanford HAI)](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2021-04/DesigningEthicalTech.pdf)
* 🎥 [The Ethical Design Handbook — Smashing Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycVi8wlzR5g)


### Submission

* Log submission here → [Submission Log Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/131My2Yo2ekHu9KR9v0-NOfFENDiNm8rT0UEXBhUrkbc/edit?usp=drivesdk)
