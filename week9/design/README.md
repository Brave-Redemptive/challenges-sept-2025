# Product Design Week 9 Challenge

## Challenge Title

**Designing with Intent: Aligning UX Decisions with Product & Business Goals**

## Scenario / Description

You’ve joined **GoalCraft**, a rapidly growing B2B SaaS company that provides workflow automation tools for small businesses. While the product has strong functionality, the leadership team is concerned that many design decisions in the interface seem disconnected from the **core business goals**—increasing user activation, improving retention, and reducing onboarding friction.

As a **Product Designer**, your task this week is to design user-centric experiences that are *deeply aligned* with both **product strategy** and **business objectives**. You will map design choices to measurable product outcomes, ensuring every pattern and flow is intentional and contributes to company goals.

This challenge focuses on **design strategy**, **goal-oriented UX**, and **structured rationale**—the skills that distinguish junior designers from product-driven designers.

---

## Challenge Overview

You are required to:

* Choose one **business objective** to design for (e.g., user activation, onboarding completion, engagement, monetization, reduction in support tickets).
* Create a **goal-aligned user flow** that directly supports that objective.
* Design **3–5 high-fidelity screens** demonstrating key interactions.
* Build a **mini design rationale** showing how each design choice supports a product or business goal.
* Present your solution via Figma, Sketch, or Framer.

---

## Instructions

1. Select a **product/business goal**, such as:

   * Increase onboarding completion rate.
   * Improve trial-to-paid conversion.
   * Increase daily active usage.
   * Reduce user confusion during setup.
   * Increase retention or long-term engagement.
2. Define the **primary user flow** that impacts this goal.
3. Design **3–5 UI screens** that support this flow.
4. Ensure that the design incorporates:

   * Clear problem–goal framing.
   * UX patterns chosen intentionally to support business outcomes.
   * Copywriting that reinforces product value.
   * UI hierarchy that aligns with user motivations and business priorities.
5. Your prototype link (Figma/Sketch/Framer) must be **accessible (view/comment access)**.
6. Prepare a **Google Doc** containing:

   * The business goal and success metric.
   * The design strategy (why this flow, why this approach).
   * Annotated screens showing how each part of the UI aligns with the goal.
   * Expected user behavioral outcome.

---

## Expected Deliverables

* **Figma / Sketch / Framer link** (accessible).
* **Google Doc** explaining:

  * Business goal and success metrics.
  * User flow selection and reasoning.
  * Annotated UI screens.
  * How UI decisions map to product strategy.
